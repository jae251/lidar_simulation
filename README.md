lidar_simulation
================

Create a point cloud from a scene built from .obj 3D model files.
Just add a list of models and the scene builder script easily creates random distributions of objects.
The lidar script creates point clouds from these scenes by ray tracing. 
Best used for fast and simple test data creation for object recognition from point clouds.
